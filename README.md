# SimpleStatistics
Learning some maths and data structures by coding them.

MathTools methods:
- frequency distribution (<String>, <Double>
- mode from freq. distr.
- mean from freq. dist.
- geometric mean from freq dist (not working!)
- geometric mean from arrayList

Read
- methods for reading from
	-keyboard
- to 
	- strings
	- ints
	- doubles

Interaction between methods:
	- ints to strings
	- doubles to strings

ToDo:

Read
- from keyboard (ok)
- text file
- csv
- xls etc.

Save
- dataset
- prints

MathTools
- observations --> list (ok)
- frequency distribution --> hashmap (ok)
	- add percentages
- sum frequency

- ordering

- class limits, classification

descriptive statistics
- mode ok
- median
	- quartiles, fractiles
- mean (arithmetic?)
	- geometric (ok)
	- harmonic

- class average

dispersion
- range
- quartile range & poikkeama
- variance
- standard deviation

- dependency ratio (? -- riippuvuuskertoimet)

- correlation
- covariance
